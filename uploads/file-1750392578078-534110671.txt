Project Details:
This project is to sync events created within Google calendar with the corresponding task created within Bitrix24 CRM. Marketing consultation appointments are created between the company's consultant and the prospective customers by the company's call center agents using the Bitrix24 appointment booking system. Once the appointment is created in Bitrix24, an event is created in the consultant's Google calendar for this appointment. However, the created event doesn't have enough details as the company want to have the customer information within the calendar event. To achieve this, a task is created in Bitrix24 for this appointment and the task contains all the customer information needed.
