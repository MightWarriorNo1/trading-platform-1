Here is a new overview of the new software - Project Overview for Bert
Platform Name: Resolve AI ‚Äî For Tradies
Purpose: A smart, AI-powered platform built specifically to help tradespeople and subcontractors across Australia manage legal and contractual issues without needing a lawyer.
What‚Äôs Already Been Completed / Mapped Out
Platform Concept
- Built for trades facing common issues like unpaid work, contract disputes, variation disagreements, and more.
- Uses AI + automation to deliver actionable legal plans, generate letters/contracts, and guide users through resolution ‚Äî without legal fees.
- Split between Case Files (disputes/issues) and Contract Files (new projects and protections).
- AI trained agent who knows and understands, all the Australian Legislation, Acts, Building Codes and other relevant documents for air tight advice.
User Flow (Frontend)
1. Landing Page:
- Speaks directly to trade pain points.
- Converts interest into action via ‚ÄúApply for Help‚Äù form or ‚ÄúCreate a Contract‚Äù.
2. Application Form (Step 1):

3. AI-Generated Response (Step 2):
- Within 24 hours, user gets a YES/ACCEPTED reply with:
- $299 payment link
- Link to complete detailed intake form
- Details of what they‚Äôll receive
4. Payment + Intake Form (Step 3):
- They pay $299 for one-time access
- Complete a detailed questionnaire to generate a case strategy or contract
5. PDF + Dashboard Access (Step 4):

Ready for Handoff
I‚Äôve already completed:
- Platform architecture
- User journey mapping
- Copywriting for landing page and dashboard
- Case study structure and PDF samples



What I need now is the build and technical integrations to bring it all together.

I would like to work in stages - so I can see the work being completed before we move to the next stage.
