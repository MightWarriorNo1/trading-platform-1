Mission:Create a transformative AI-powered platform that helps tradespeople and subcontractors across Australia handle legal and contractual issues they often face — especially when they don’t know where to start or how to respond.

This isn’t a legal service, and we are not lawyers. Instead, we use AI technology and industry knowledge to help users take control, get clarity, and resolve disputes with confidence.

🎯 Who This Platform Helps:

Trades and subcontractors working across all trades and states in Australia

Common issues include:

❒ Unpaid work

❒ Variation disputes

❒ Termination/removal from site

❒ Defect or quality claims

❒ Contract confusion or disputes

❒ Other (they're unsure how to handle)

🗂️ User Portal Structure

Upon signing up and making payment, users gain access to a secure dashboard — called The Dashboard — which houses two distinct and clearly separated sections:

🔹 1. Case Files

These are focused on dispute resolution for current or past issues.

Each case file contains:

Documents Folder: Stores all uploaded evidence, letters, communications, photos.

Timeline Tracker: Chronological record of events, including deadlines, reminders, and communication logs.

Next Steps & Guidance: Clear action plan with AI-generated insights and recommended steps.

Google/Outlook Calendar Sync: Key dates are linked to user's calendar.

Mail reference fields for tracking sent correspondence.

🔹 2. Contract Files

These are focused on project prevention and protection — new contract generation for future jobs.

Each contract file includes:

Document Folder: Stores all versions — DRAFT, FINAL, SIGNED.

Timeline Tracker: Logs all contract actions — sent dates, signed dates, amendments.

Amendments Tracker: A module for logging variations to work scope, which are then sent as contract addendums.

Version Control: Each update creates a new version of the contract, stored chronologically.

✅ Why Two Sections? This separation allows trades to clearly distinguish between resolving past issues and preventing future ones. It reinforces the professional approach of the platform and makes navigation intuitive and structured.
