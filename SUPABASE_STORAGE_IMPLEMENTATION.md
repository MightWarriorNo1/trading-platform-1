# Supabase Storage Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated the entire Project Resolve AI file upload/download system from local file storage (multer) to **Supabase Storage** for improved scalability, security, and cloud integration.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Backend Supabase Storage Service
- **File**: `server/supabase-storage-service.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Private bucket with authentication-based access
  - File upload with organized folder structure (`users/{userId}/cases/{caseId}/`)
  - Secure file download with signed URLs
  - File metadata management in PostgreSQL database
  - Automatic cleanup of temporary files
  - Support for 10MB file size limit
  - Allowed file types: PDF, DOC, DOCX, JPG, PNG, GIF, WEBP, TXT, EML, MSG

### 2. Frontend Supabase Storage Client
- **File**: `client/src/lib/supabase-storage.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Direct integration with Supabase Auth for secure uploads
  - File validation before upload
  - Progress tracking and error handling
  - File download and preview functionality
  - Utility functions for file formatting and icons

### 3. Database Schema Updates
- **File**: `supabase-storage-migration.sql`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `supabase_url` and `supabase_path` columns to documents table
  - Made `upload_path` nullable for backward compatibility
  - Created RLS policies for secure document access
  - Storage bucket configuration with proper permissions

### 4. Updated API Routes
- **File**: `server/supabase-routes.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - All file upload endpoints now use Supabase Storage
  - Document download routes use signed URLs
  - File listing endpoints query from Supabase Storage
  - Proper authentication and authorization throughout

### 5. Frontend Component Updates
- **Files**: `client/src/components/file-upload.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated to use new Supabase Storage client
  - Improved file validation using storage service
  - Better error handling and user feedback

## File Organization Structure
```
Supabase Storage Bucket: "documents"
├── users/
│   └── {userId}/
│       ├── cases/
│       │   └── {caseId}/
│       │       └── {timestamp}_{randomId}.{ext}
│       └── contracts/
│           └── {contractId}/
│               └── {timestamp}_{randomId}.{ext}
```

## Security Features
- **Private bucket**: Files require authentication to access
- **Row Level Security**: Database policies ensure users only access their own files
- **Signed URLs**: Temporary access links with expiration
- **File validation**: Size and type restrictions enforced
- **User isolation**: Files organized by user ID to prevent cross-user access

## How It Works

### File Upload Process
1. Frontend validates file (size, type)
2. File sent to backend API endpoint
3. Backend uploads to Supabase Storage with organized path
4. File metadata saved to PostgreSQL database
5. Signed URL generated for access
6. Temporary local file cleaned up
7. Response returned with file metadata

### File Download Process
1. Frontend requests file download
2. Backend validates user has access to file
3. File downloaded from Supabase Storage
4. File served to frontend with proper headers
5. Frontend displays or downloads file

### File Listing Process
1. Frontend requests user's files (with optional filters)
2. Backend queries database for user's file metadata
3. Files filtered by case/contract/category as needed
4. File list returned with metadata and access URLs

## Migration Benefits
- **Scalability**: No local storage limitations
- **Security**: Proper authentication and RLS policies
- **Reliability**: Cloud storage with automatic backups
- **Performance**: CDN-powered file delivery
- **Cost-effective**: Pay-per-use storage model
- **Integration**: Seamless with existing Supabase Auth

## Required Setup Steps
1. Run `supabase-storage-migration.sql` in Supabase SQL editor
2. Ensure Supabase environment variables are configured:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
3. Storage bucket "documents" will be created automatically
4. RLS policies will be applied for secure access

## Backward Compatibility
- Existing files with `upload_path` will continue to work
- New files use `supabase_path` for cloud storage
- Database schema supports both legacy and new file storage methods
- Gradual migration path for existing installations

## File Types Supported
- **Documents**: PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT
- **Images**: JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF, WEBP
- **Email**: EML, MSG files
- **Size Limit**: 10MB per file
- **Security**: Virus scanning and content validation

The implementation provides a robust, scalable file storage solution that integrates seamlessly with the existing Project Resolve AI architecture while maintaining security and user experience standards.
